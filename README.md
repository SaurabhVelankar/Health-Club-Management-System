# Health-Club-Management-System
A web-based Health Club Management System made using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

The site uses a simple primitive UI, made using external CSS files, and has JavaScript validation for login and form submissions.
Users can log in as an Administrator or as a Member/trainer. After logging in as an Administrator, the administrator can use his privileges to add a new member to the database. One can also add/remove a health plan for the particular member.
If one is logged in as a member/trainer, one can check their BMI and suggest new diet plans for others.

Form validation is handled through JavaScript. Basic Styling is added using external .css files. Basic HTML features include forms, navigation bar, submit buttons, and more.
